# Case Creator App
As my bachelor's thesis I developed a full stack application for creating personalized phone cases. 
Users can choose from phone cases and game console templates. They can place custom images or text on the selected template, on which they can perform various transformations. From the completed template, an SVG file can be generated, from which the product can be printed, or it can be uploaded to a database from where it can be accessed for later editing. During the development of the application we used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, .NET, SQLite and SVG technologies.
